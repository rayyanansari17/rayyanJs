// what is JSON ?

/*

JSON stands for javascript object notation 
it is a lightweight format for storing and transferring data between client and a server 

JSON( javascript object notation) is the universal language of data interchange in modern computing 
it is lightweight , human radable and machine parsable

every major programming language (python , java, go, rust, etc) can parse and generate JSON easily 

universal format (used in 99% APIs)

no need for extra encoding / decoding layers

it looks like javascript objects but is actually a text format 


 */


// why JSON is universal 

/*
language independent - works in all languages (js,pythons,java,go,etc)

lightweight - faster than XML and programs

flexible - supports nested structures, arrays, objects 

standardized - defined by ECMA-404

secure - no code execution (unlike XML parsers)

extensible - can be used for configs, APIs, logs, data storage
