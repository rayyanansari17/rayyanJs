// loops
/*
loops are used to execute a block of coe repreatedly as long as a condition is true.
the y help avoid writing the same code multiple times.


there are 2 types of loops 
1. basics and advance 
2. advanced loops 

// basic loop ==> for loop, while loop, do while loop
*/

// for loop:
// runs a block of code a specific number of times.

// synta for  ... for loop

// for (initialize,condition, increment)
// {
// code to repeat 
// }


// 1. initialize ==> where to start
// 2. condition checks always for true to execute code block
// 3. code block what to repeat 
// 4. increment the number 


for (let i = 5; i<= 10; i++){
    console.log("hello", i);
}
